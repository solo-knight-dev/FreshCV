    <h1>Guide To Fill Resume</h1><br>
    <p>1>Creating your resume is easier than you think! Start with your basic details like your full name, phone number, email,
         and where you're from. Then, write a short career goal — just one or two lines about what kind of job you,re looking for. 
         After that, list your education from latest to oldest. Don,t forget to include the year and marks if you,d like.</p><br>
    <p>2>Next, add your skills — these can be anything from computer knowledge like MS Office or coding, to soft skills like teamwork or
        communication. If you,ve done any small projects, internships, or even personal work like building a website or helping in a 
        family business, write about that too. It shows you,re active and learning!</p><br>
    <p>3>Lastly, include any achievements, languages you speak, and hobbies you enjoy. These help show your personality and make your resume more 
        interesting. Keep everything neat and short, download the pdf, and you,re good to go! Just remember — be honest and keep it simple. 
        You've got this!</p><br>
